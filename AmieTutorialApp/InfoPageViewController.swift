Morgan State University's engineering students tutor Monday through Wednesday evenings at Morgan State University's Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. School of Engineering. The eight-week program is offered in the fall and spring. Students may attend all three tutorial sessions but are required to attend two sessions per week. They are tested at the beginning and end of the program to measure their progress."
